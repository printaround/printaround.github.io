			<h3>Falling to the ground</h3>
			<p>C#, Unity</p>
			<p>Categories: parkour, puzzle, action, self test</p>
			<p>In this game you need to go through a maze with many obstacles and puzzles. I tried to make this game challenging, but passable. I guarantee that it is impossible to complete the game the first time, if you have low stress resistance, I do not recommend even trying. I developed a very interesting gameplay mechanics, but we can do without spoilers, download and you will know everything yourself.</p>

			<h3>Annoying Haru</h3>

			<h3>JOHN'S MATH</h3>
			<p>C#, Console</p>
			<p>Categories: Math</p>
			<p>Technically, this is my very first digital game. I decided to add it for the sake of nostalgia and because I considered it quite playable, even by its current standards. The game is a console dialogue with an assistant, where you have to solve simple mathematical examples, but the main point of the game is how you interact with the assistant, since it will depend on what kind of ending you get (like there are only 3 of them). I will not attach the source code for obvious reasons ... however, I decided to leave it in its original form, so I do not advise leaving an empty line at the moments where you need to enter a number, otherwise the program will throw an exception.</p>
