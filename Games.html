		<h3>Социальный кредит</h3>

		<h3>Find me in the tunnel</h3>
		<p>C#, Unity</p>
		<p>Categories: survival horror, puzzle</p>
		<p>The source code for this project has not been preserved. All textures in the game were drawn by me. I recommend playing with headphones. Walk through pitch-black darkness with the dim light of a flashlight. You have to solve puzzles and run away from enemies.</p>

		<h3>Falling to the ground</h3>
		<p>C#, Unity</p>
		<p>Categories: parkour, puzzle, action, self test</p>
		<p>The game is very old, crooked and weird, but still playable. Here you have to go through a labyrinth with lots of obstacles and puzzles. I tried to make this game difficult but passable. I developed a very interesting mechanics, but without spoilers, try it yourself.</p>

		<h3>Annoying Haru</h3>
		<p>C#, WPF</p>
		<p>Categories: Visual novel</p>
		<p>When I first started working with WPF, the idea immediately came to do something similar. This is a small visual novel. It is short and has a simple plot. In this project, the main interest is directly its implementation. When downloading, you will receive a compiled game and all sources.</p>

		<h3>JOHN'S MATH</h3>
		<p>C#, Console</p>
		<p>Categories: Math</p>
		<p>Technically, this is my very first digital game. I decided to add it for the sake of nostalgia and because I considered it quite playable, even by its current standards. The game is a console dialogue with an assistant, where you have to solve simple mathematical examples, but the main point of the game is how you interact with the assistant, since it will depend on what kind of ending you get (like there are only 3 of them). I will not attach the source code for obvious reasons ... however, I decided to leave it in its original form, so I do not advise leaving an empty line at the moments where you need to enter a number, otherwise the program will throw an exception.</p>
